CODE LOUISVILLE C# PROJECT GUIDE  
=======================================================

This is a very basic C# program to create Pokemon Teams. 
A CSV file is available for all existing Pokemon to be listed. 
The application asks for the user to input 6 different Pokemon names, 
compares them to the CSV file to make sure they are correctly input, 
then writes those names to a .txt file. 
Once the team list is created the application allows the user to also view their created team. 

A big THANK YOU to all the <code> Louisville folks for this opportunity... and taking a look!
